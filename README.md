Investigating why Cybersecurity is Underrated: “With the concern regarding the talent gap in the cybersecurity job market, what factors can help predict whether an individual ends up in the cybersecurity job market?”

According to CyberSeek—a project initiated to close this gap—the national average of the supply/demand ratio (workers/jobs) is around 74%.[] In other words, for every 4 jobs available, there are only approximately 3 qualified individuals in the United States workforce to occupy them. The issue of “the cybersecurity talent gap” has been known for around a decade by this point, and it expands far beyond just the United States; this is a global problem.[] While some literature and programs already exist with the intention of bridging said gap, the issue persists even now.

The datasets used in this study were obtained from Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS). Per WRDS data use agreement, these datasets cannot be shared publicly or uploaded to external repositories, as researchers wishing to access the data must obtain their own access through WRDS. Therefore, you will not see these datasets, nor files with their contents, in this repository.
